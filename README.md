Here will be a few projects to get reacclimated with python and 
astrophysical computer. Will update the README as I figure out what I'm 
doing . for now just 玩一玩 . 

1. Get a GUI working for the evolution plots

2. make a movie of what the expansion would look like
 2.1 use a (scale factor) as the radius of a sphere and plot the 
evolution at different timesteps. 
	2.1.1 could be done by taking the value of a at every timestep 
(see where is the best place to plot---maybe make the timestep equal to 
10, 100, etc) make an individual image of the sphere at each time. and 
stitch the plot-image (.png files) into a continuous movie of 
expansion/contraction. While displaying the time and scale factor at the 
given time

3. Iron out why the plots are not working for open/closed universes in 
the second part

4. Redo the csv values of sne, with an included error. Maybe find 
another source. so that the errors can be managed and displayed.
